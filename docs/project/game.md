# Laboinfra Game Hosting Service

## Overview
We provides hosting services for the schoolâ€™s video game associations. This initiative ensures that gaming communities within ESGI have access to reliable and efficient server resources.

## Dedicated Infrastructure
To support this service, We operate dedicated servers specifically allocated for game hosting. These servers are managed using **Pterodactyl**, a powerful and flexible game server management platform.

## Management & Accessibility
The administrators of each gaming association have access to Pterodactyl, allowing them to deploy and manage their own game servers independently while benefiting from our infrastructure.

This service enhances the gaming ecosystem by providing robust and scalable hosting solutions for student-led gaming communities.
